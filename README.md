# SmartOrderRouter
A Smart Order Router implementation based on research paper by A. Adhami (see doc folder).  This project does not 'copy-n-paste' design and implementation discussed in the paper.  I plan on highlighting my changes. 

### Motivation
I had following questions:<br>
Why do we need Smart Order Router (SOR)?<br>
Why not send orders directly to markets just like in the past? <br>
Are there any programming languages for low latency development? <br>
What is new in C++11? <br>

### Objective
Develop an *ultra low latency Smart Order Router (SOR)* for *Linux*. Use *test driven development* methodology and use *C++11* as the prmary implemenation language. Use *multi-threading* and *lock free* datastructures to acheive *micro-second* performance.

### Conflict Of Interest
There are none with my day job. All research and work is done outside of office hours.  My day job is developing *Algo trading* application in *Java* where trading algorithms (VWAP,TWAP etc.) run.  I have knowledge of trading algos but I don't implement them in my day job.  That is done by a separate team.  <br>
SOR development team is different and I don't have access to any part of that system.

### Timeline
A solid implementaiton will take some time since I have a day job and a family.  However, my mindset is that I will learn something even if I don't get to finish.

### Environment
1) Intel i7-6500, 16gb ram, 512 gb SSD<br>
2) Windows 10 - cheaper than other alternatives (where I live) and easier to carry on the go.<br>
3) RedHat Cygwin 64 bit<br>
4) g++ 2.9.3 w/ C++11 flags<br>
5) Git and GitHub <br>
